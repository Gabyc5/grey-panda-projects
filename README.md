## Projects and Coursework

Within this repository is a collection of my projects from various computer science courses and personal work. It includes:

- **Random Projects**: Independent coding projects ranging from small scripts to larger applications.
- **Coursework**: Coding assignments and exercises from courses like Operating Systems, Data Structures, and introductory programming classes, showcasing my development over time.
- **Library Management Web App**: I developed the front-end for multiple pages (Home, Admin Dashboard, Catalog, Checkout, etc.) and implemented key back-end functionality, including catalog search/filter, user authentication, and item checkout/return processes. I also integrated Twilio for notifications, created database triggers, and set up hosting for the entire project. [Link to Library App Repo](https://github.com/Gabyc5/Team7-Library-Database.git)

  - *Note: The MySQL database instance hosted on Azure has been turned off to avoid ongoing costs. As a result, some functionality that relies on the database may not be available.*

Each folder corresponds to a specific project or class, providing a snapshot of the variety of skills and technologies I have worked with.
